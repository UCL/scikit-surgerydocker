Setting up Docker
=================

Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. 
Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly.  
By taking advantage of Dockerâ€™s methodologies for shipping, testing, and deploying code quickly, 
you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production [`reference 1`_].
